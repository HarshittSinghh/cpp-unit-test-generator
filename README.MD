## C++ Unit Test Generator with Ollama & CodeLlama
This project includes an AI-powered Unit Test Generator that automatically creates and refines unit tests for your C++ application ‚Äî using Ollama and the CodeLlama:7B model. It integrates prompt engineering and YAML-based instruction refinement for test generation, debugging, and build validation.

Core Features
 - Reads C++ source files (like Job.cc) and generates unit tests with AI.
 - Uses YAML-based strict instruction prompts to guide the LLM.
 - Iteratively refines test cases to remove duplicates and improve structure.
 - Unit tests generated in Google Test format.
 - Supports build + test cycle with feedback loops on build failures.
 - Output test files stored in tests/ directory.
